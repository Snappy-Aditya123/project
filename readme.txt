# AI Education & Job Market Bot

Welcome to my AI Education & Job Market Bot project! This is my first big project where I aim to build something useful and cool using my AI and programming skills. The bot is designed to help with educational queries and provide insights into job market trends for four specific areas: **Physics**, **English**, **Marketing**, and **Business**.

---

## **About the Project**
The main idea behind this project is to create a lightweight, efficient bot that can:
- Answer basic educational questions.
- Provide recommendations for courses and learning resources.
- Offer job market trends and insights (like what roles are in demand and what skills are needed).

I want to make this bot run efficiently on modern PCs and keep it simple yet functional. Later, I might add more advanced features, but for now, I’m focusing on the basics. This is my first step toward building something that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), data science, and practical problem-solving.

## **How It Works**
The project is broken down into three iterations:

### **Iteration 1**
- **Data Collection**: Gathering open-source data for Physics, English, Marketing, and Business, as well as job market information from platforms like LinkedIn or Kaggle.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and formatting it to make it ready for training.
- **Basic Bot Setup**: Training a lightweight NLP model (like DistilBERT) to handle basic educational and job-related queries.
- **Basic Interaction**: Creating a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

### **Iteration 2**
- Adding features like personalized recommendations and trend analysis.
- Training the model on larger datasets for better performance.
- Building a web interface to make the bot more user-friendly.

### **Iteration 3**
- Exploring advanced features (still figuring this out, but maybe something like multi-turn conversations or deeper analysis).

## **Current Status**
- I’m currently working on **Iteration 1**, focusing on data collection and setting up the basic bot functionality. 
- This includes gathering data, preprocessing it, and training a simple model to get things running.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - Flask or Streamlit (for the optional web interface)
  - NLTK or SpaCy (for text processing)
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control, Kaggle for datasets

## **Why This Project?**
As a computer science student, I’m really excited about using AI to solve real-world problems. This project is my way of learning and applying NLP and data science skills while creating something that could actually help people. Plus, I’m hoping it’ll look great on my portfolio (and maybe help me with future scholarship applications).

## **What’s Next?**
- Finish collecting and preprocessing the data.
- Train a basic NLP model.
- Build a simple interface for testing the bot.
