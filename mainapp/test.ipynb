      "Content: <p>My friend and colleague George Coulouris, who has died aged 87, was a visionary researcher of personal computers and a cycling campaigner. </p> <p>In 1965, as a lecturer at Imperial College London, he started work on ICL’s content-addressable file store, which sped up BT’s directory inquiries. He then moved in 1971 to Queen Mary and Westfield College (now Queen Mary, University of London), progressing from lecturer to reader to professor in the department of computer science. There, he worked to show that the hardware guru John Iliffe’s designs had real advantages over mainframes of the day.</p> <p>In the mid-1970s he pivoted towards interactive computing. In a converted cinema he made a computer systems lab. In 1975 the lab was first in the UK to import Unix, now the basis of the internet. He wrote “em”, a very early interactive editor, which became the basis of “vi”, used by hackers.</p> <p>The lab had desks with low dividers, fast terminals to support a display editor, free coffee with bean bags to sit on and no staff hierarchy. There were hardware geeks, programming-language evangelists and philosophers of interaction. George encouraged cooperation with a shy smile. A spin-off company, Whitechapel Workstations, briefly tussled with US groups.</p> <p>From 1999 to 2004, George was a part-time senior research fellow in the department of engineering at Cambridge University. He then became a senior research fellow, then a visiting professor in residence at the computer laboratory. He retired in 2016.</p>    <p>George was born in New York, to Louise Franklin, an artist, and <a href=\"https://coulouris.net/gc_archive/memorials/Guardian.html\">George Coulouris</a>, an English actor. In 1939 the family moved to Los Angeles then, in 1949, to London, where George Jr attended Westminster school. He learned to program during a gap year at IBM (1956-57), where he met Iliffe.</p> <p>After graduating from University College London with a physics degree in 1960, he worked briefly at the Central Electricity and Gas Board before moving to London University. In 1963, he started work on the first compiler for the programming language CPL, at the Institute of Computer Science (ICS).</p> <p>George met Jean Dollimore in the early 60s, when they were both at ICS, and they married in 2001. They lived part-time on a canal boat during the 80s, in Regent’s Park, then in Cambridge, where George worked part-time at Harlequin software company. Together they wrote the textbook Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design (1988), now in its fifth edition.</p> <p>From the 60s George cycled, commuting to work, and travelled long distances on holidays with Jean, eventually on a converted Moulton tandem of his own design. He campaigned for better cycle provision and built data-visualisation apps, showing traffic interventions on readable maps. George was also a competent amateur cellist, latterly with the <a href=\"https://www.aeoliansinfonia.com/\">Aeolian Sinfonia</a>.</p> <p>He is survived by Jean, two children, Sue and Anna, from his first marriage, to Christine Tinson, which ended in divorce, three stepchildren, Rachel, Julian and Jason, from Jean’s previous relationship, and 11 grandchildren. George’s sister, <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/feb/02/mary-louise-coulouris\">Mary Louise</a>, died in 2011.</p>...\n",

      "Content: <p>One afternoon in Los Angeles in 2000, only seven years after he began releasing records, Will Oldham met two people who would “stay in my mind for the rest of my life”. The first was a gruff sound engineer, David “Ferg” Ferguson, who had been mentored by “Cowboy” Jack Clement, the renowned Sun Records producer who worked with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. The second, whom Oldham first saw in Rick Rubin’s studio hallway – “I’ll be unpacking this for the rest of my life” – was Johnny Cash.</p> <p>“His physical size and his legacy towered over me at first and then steadily, warmly diminished,” Oldham remembers. Oldham had just turned 30; Cash was 68, ailing, but working hard on his third album of later-life covers, <em>American Recordings III: Solitary Man</em>. It included the title track from Oldham’s 1999 breakthrough album, <em>I See a Darkness</em>, his first under the moniker of Bonnie “Prince” Billy (one he’s been embarrassed about in the past, but loves now, “because the spirit of creation of that entity was that it had to be all about fun”).</p> <p>A devastating, intimate song about love, the will to live and how depression lingers quietly, brutally, in so many people’s lives, I See a Darkness arrived like a hushed modern standard in the making. It’s since been covered – brilliantly – by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg7GJghu4Zo\">flamenco superstar Rosalía</a>; as a smooth, soulful ballad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drp5vBXGyuA\">by Paul Young</a>; and most recently as a club banger by Hot Chip’s Alexis Taylor and techno producer Mike Simonetti (Taylor previewed it on his Instagram stories; it will be released later this year). Back in 2000, Cash asked Oldham to help him sing the track, while Ferg guided them warmly. Oldham and Ferg struck up a fast friendship thereafter, and for his new album, <em>The Purple Bird</em>, Oldham has Ferg as its sole producer, the first time this has happened in his 32-year career. “The producer is usually nominally me,” he says, a little embarrassed. “Although the ensemble is the producer, really.”</p> <p>Born in Louisville, Kentucky, where he still lives today, Oldham began adulthood as a young actor, impressing critics as a teenage preacher in John Sayles’s 1987 epic, <em>Matewan</em>, before leaving “the repulsiveness of Hollywood”, and having a breakdown in his early 20s. To help, his older brother, Ned, suggested he start writing songs: 22 solo albums, more than 30 EPs, countless singles, and many collaborations have followed, some with friends from alternative and folk scenes, but also names such as Björk, Candi Staton and the National’s Bryce Dessner.</p>    <p>Interview-shy at the beginning of his career, Oldham’s image early on was almost mythological, gnomic (singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis captured his essence in 2005 track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiizrUsC_hY\">Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror</a>, saying “if you look at indie-rock culture you really can’t ignore him”). His music arrived salted with flavours of folk, country and DIY experimentation, with tender, eloquent lyrics (many are in his beautiful 2018 anthology, <em>Songs of Love and Horror</em>). But his wide-ranging tastes have become clearer as he’s got older; he’s covered songs from Bruce Springsteen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/05/bill-callahan-bonnie-prince-billy-blind-date-party-review\">Billie Eilish</a>, Merle Haggard to Mariah Carey. He’s just read Carey’s memoirs, in fact, he tells me at our photoshoot: “Her book is really, really<em> </em>good – it’s with a ghostwriter, sure, but I was wonderfully shocked at her eloquence and the depth of self-perception”.</p> <p>He dances, grins, and yawns playfully for our photographer and politely asks if he can play an old NTS Radio show on his phone. “I fucking love radio,” he says, later. “Momentarily loving the relationship of the DJ to that piece of music – I don’t need anything else.” His words can sound gentle and monastic in print, but in person, he’s a warm, welcoming presence. Sometimes serious, but always quietly disarming. Just like his music, in fact.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>T<em>he Purple Bird</em> is named after a childhood chalk drawing by Ferg. It hangs, framed in glass, in a room above Ferg’s garage, which serves as guest lodgings for close friends. “It says what school he was at, which is long closed and overgrown. Anyone who comes in this apartment is somebody he knows and trusts and appreciates on some level. He wants us to see it. It’s very charming.” Ferg organised Nashville-style writing sessions for Oldham with stars of bluegrass and country and brought in A-list session musicians. The results place Oldham in a timeless, country-warmed world. His voice, sometimes tender, sometimes frisky, carries songs about longing (Spend the Whole Night With You), infidelity (Boise, Idaho), and overcoming divisions: “No matter what side you’re standing on/ Can’t we all just get along,” swings the catchy opener, Turned to Dust (Rolling On).</p>    <p>There are other slyly political moments. Guns Are for Cowards is styled like a drinking song, buoyant with jaunty brass and accordion, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQbAPyGiPwI\">Downstream</a> is about climate and pollution and came from an idea by John Anderson, one of Oldham’s singing heroes, “who is fairly conservative politically,” Oldham says. “And that’s what the spirit of this record is saying to me, how unfortunately and dishonestly divisive and ridiculous the political landscape is in the United States, because there we were – people of different ages and experiences – sitting there making music, having a ball.”</p> <p>He picks up his phone on the table, in a cute, furry cover picked by his five-year-old daughter, Poppy. “We live in a world where these devices distort things so much.” Still, he wasn’t surprised when Trump was elected. “I don’t think I have room in my heart any more for surprise. I think the morning after [George W] Bush beat John Kerry [in 2004] I was genuinely surprised, but also I think a part of my heart withered and died at that moment. And to be honest, around three o’clock on election day [in November] I realised what was going to happen.” He hasn’t looked at a newspaper since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That connection between a listener and music is something so valuable that I always want to feel it, to get there, too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His focus has turned local. Two weeks after the election, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/18/us/louisville-factory-explosion-cause-cooking-vessel-hnk/index.html\">an explosion</a> in a factory less than a mile from his house killed two people and injured a dozen. “It made me realise terrible things are happening in my neighbourhood that I should spend more time on rather than things over which I have absolutely no control.” Family life has strengthened that resolve. In 2016, he married textile artist Elsa Hansen, who walked up the aisle to a Merle Haggard covers band (“of which Ferg was a part”) and their daughter was born in 2019. His mother, Jo, was a teacher who made art quietly and passionately at home, but never showed it to anyone else. “She was distraught over this idea of who she was. I think she was probably like me.” Oldham was embarrassed to call himself an artist for years, even though he craved a “community of friends and family through music that felt absent elsewhere for whatever reason”.</p> <p>Why was he embarrassed? “Because I kept thinking, why can’t I do something that’s real? It’s taken me a long time to understand that this is what I am, and more recently to start to become somewhat OK with it.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQbAPyGiPwI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQbAPyGiPwI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQbAPyGiPwI\">Listen to Downstream from The Purple Bird by Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The realisation has helped him bloom. When he’s told strangers on plane journeys and in casual conversations over the years that he makes music for a living, he’s noticed they’re “so vicariously uplifted by it”. He also realises now how powerful music is in the world, although the flipside of this is that big business knows too. “It’s how [Spotify’s] Daniel Ek can make billions of dollars. He knows people need music, and that when they access it, they’re at their most vulnerable. With music, we give ourselves up. It’s when we’re allowed to be ourselves.”</p> <p>Music shouldn’t be dismissed as escapism, however, nor our discovery of it be driven by algorithms: “It’s doing it a disservice to think of it that way. It’s crucial and essential and sustaining.” For him, making music is “about feelings about love and friendship – about connections that I’ve made with people”. Not about songs on a screen, but in the studio, on the stage, existing in the heart and the soul. “It’s about that connection between a listener and music, which is something so valuable.” He smiles. “So valuable that I always want to feel it, to get there, too.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Purple Bird</em> is out 31 January on Domino</p></li> </ul>...\n",

      "Content: <p>The original <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/nov/03/features.phelimoneill\">Emmanuelle</a></em>, a tale of a young woman’s erotic adventures in Bangkok, was a tawdry, trashy romp, a French-sploitation sexcapade that should have been filed away in a drawer marked: “It was different in the 70s, honestly.” Instead – inexplicably – it has been disinterred by director Audrey Diwan (quite the change of pace after her harrowing Venice prize-winning abortion drama <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/24/happening-review-unflinching-french-abortion-drama\">Happening</a></em>). Diwan relocates the action to Hong Kong and remakes <em>Emmanuelle</em> as a glossy but dispiriting treatise on the emptiness of the corporate world, punctuated by lots of panting, lip-chewing abandon.</p> <p>Noémie Merlant (<em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em>) plays Emmanuelle, whose job seems to entail being bitchy in various luxury hotels. Her taste for the high life is only matched by her appetite for anonymous carnal activities. But what Emmanuelle craves most is the one thing she can’t have: enigmatic flood defences engineer (no, really) Kei Shinohara (Will Sharpe, wearing the pained expression of someone who has just found an errant toenail clipping in his Egyptian cotton hotel bed linen).

      "URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order\n",
      "Content: <p>TikTok <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-says-it-is-restoring-service-us-2025-01-19/\">said</a> on Sunday that it was restoring services in the US after Donald Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050\">pledged</a> earlier in the day to give the video app a reprieve on its US ban.</p> <p>Trump wrote on Truth Social that after taking office on Monday he would sign an executive order allowing the Chinese-owned video app additional time to find a buyer before facing a total shutdown, and proposing that the US or an American firm take a 50% ownership stake.</p> <p>“By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say (sic) up,” Trump said. “Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions.”</p> <p>TikTok stopped working in the US for 170 million users late on Saturday. Congress passed a law in April mandating its owner, ByteDance, either sell to a non-Chinese company or face a total shutdown. The app chose the shutdown after the US supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/17/politics-updates-supreme-court-tiktok?page=with:block-678a69dc8f08e357fb1e1097\">ruled </a>to uphold the ban on Friday.</p> <p>“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” stated a pop-up message to US users on TikTok on Saturday night, which came as something of a surprise, given that the law only required app stores to remove it. “Unfortunately that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”</p> <p>Trump attempted to intervene on TikTok’s behalf at the 11th hour, even though it was Trump who initially pushed for the ban. But he changed his tune after finding a large audience on the app during his 2024 presidential campaign.</p> <p>TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, released a video thanking Trump for his efforts to keep the app active in the US. He is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-trump-biden-china-bdc79b7ce741a81761f67ea56d410103\">expected </a>to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony in person.</p> <p>After Trump’s message on Sunday, TikTok’s website came back online for some US users, though the app itself initially remained dark.</p> <p>The incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-security-adviser-doesnt-rule-out-continued-chinese-ownership-tiktok-2025-01-19/\">told </a>CNN on Sunday that Trump hasn’t ruled out continued Chinese ownership, with “firewalls to make sure that the data is protected here on US soil”.</p> <p>He also said on CBS News on Sunday that Trump said he is working to “save” TikTok and needs time to sort out issues related to the firm and to evaluate potential buyers.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Trump could totally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/17/trump-stop-tiktok-ban\">circumvent the ban</a>, though he could order the justice department not to enforce the bill. He has also said the supreme court decision should be “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113844584193010573\">respected</a>”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, told <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5094094-mike-johnson-tiktok-ban-us-law/\">NBC’s Meet the Press </a>on Sunday that he intends to uphold the TikTok ban.</p> <p>“When President Trump issued the Truth post and said save TikTok, the way we read that is that he’s going to try to force along a true divestiture, changing of hands, the ownership,” Johnson said.</p> <p>He added members of Congress are not worried about the app itself but about the Chinese Communist Party, and said TikTok’s owners, ByteDance, had 270 days to sell the app in the US.</p> <p>Some Republicans have rejected the idea of extending the time before the ban goes into effect.</p> <p>“Now that the law has taken effect, there’s no legal basis for any kind of ‘extension’ of its effective date,” said the Senate intelligence committee chairman Tom Cotton (Republican of Arkansas) and Senator Pete Ricketts (Republican of Nebraska) in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1880965172040499650?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">joint statement</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>“For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law’s qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.”</p> <p>Several Democrats last week urged President Biden to issue a reprieve to give TikTok more time before shutting down.</p> <p>“It’s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer for TikTok,” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zlgotdjaxzuhw4nefvkxxvxa/post/3lfv3e6u7b22j?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.splinter.com%252Fidiot-democrats-hand-trump-a-gift-with-tiktok-flip-flop\">said</a> on 16 January. “We will continue working to keep TikTok alive, protect content creators’ livelihoods, protect against CCP surveillance, and protect national security. I will work with the Trump Admin to find a solution.”</p> <p>The Shark Tank celebrity investor Kevin O’Leary said on Friday he offered TikTok’s owners $20bn to buy it, while the company Perplexity AI has also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/perplexity-ai-bids-merge-with-tiktok-us-cnbc-reports-2025-01-18/\">reportedly </a>submitted a bid to merge with TikTok US, rather than purchase the app outright.</p>...\n",

      "Title: Trump and AI help inspire a Prada collection for challenging times\n",
      "Published: 2025-01-19T17:43:03Z\n",
      "URL: https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jan/19/trump-ai-help-inspire-prada-men-collection-challenging-times\n",
      "Content: <p>The day before the US presidential inauguration, it was impossible for Miuccia Prada to avoid the question. When designing her collection, just how much was fashion’s most radical intellectual thinking about Donald Trump?</p> <p>Speaking backstage at her show on the opening weekend of men’s fashion week in Milan, the 75-year-old designer, who grew up a communist and believed, like many of her generation, that change would come not through capitalism but through revolution, could only laugh. “Is it an answer to what is happening? Yes,” she said. “The world has become conservative.” As for the clothes, it wasn’t so much an autumn/winter 2025 collection as a riposte to “the first season of artificial intelligence”.</p>    <p>Speaking with her co-creative director Raf Simons, by their shared admission it was a challenging collection for challenging times. There were cream pyjamas made from buttery soft leather, bright puffer jackets layered upon puffer jackets, and oversized hoods in granny-curtain fabric. If the clothes and the fabrics looked incongruous, that was deliberate – they were trying to resist the algorithm.</p> <p>“These are things that shouldn’t be together, coming together,” said Simons. For example, he added, the men wore jewellery but sometimes the jewellery dangled from the crew-necked jumpers or lapels. Some of them wore traditional-style cowboy boots, but more than half had bare chests. Office-friendly slacks in dark grey were paired with faux-fur tabards (Prada is fur-free), “modern man meets primal”, Simons said. Even the buckled bags, which looked battered and vintage, were held the wrong way round. Dotted wittily throughout were pyjamas worn under coats, the sort of thing you might wear for a late milk run. “When I get home, I just take it all off [and get into pyjamas],” said Simons, exhaling.</p> <p>The overall effect was clothes cut to perfection but styled in an unpredictable way that seemed to resist trends and seasons. For every double puffer jacket or faux-cowhide sweater, there was a short-sleeve summer shirt and an oiled chest.</p>    <p>Even the set was “a reaction to what a set usually is”, Simons said. Models walked on two levels of unfinished scaffolding to Rossini’s La gazza ladra. Beneath their feet was a swirling blue art nouveau carpet. The lighting was both low and bright, “cinematic” said film-loving Simons, who acknowledged that the late David Lynch was an influence.</p> <p>Family-owned Prada has emerged as one of the rare winners amid a global luxury sector downturn. Routinely described as the hottest brand in the world by customers, critics and the fashion search site Lyst, Miuccia is probably the most innovative fashion designer of her generation. In 1975 she took over the family’s leather goods company. Two years later she met her future husband, Patrizio Bertelli, then running a leather goods factory, who is now chair of the Prada Group. One of the few brands not owned by a conglomerate, in 2022 the company’s annual revenue was $4.5bn. There is talk even that the Prada group will buy Versace.</p>    <p>Miuccia is not one to talk business, though. As someone who prefers to communicate through her clothes, she has consistently tried to address and react to the times, all while reconciling her artistic, leftist roots with what others might find frivolous: high fashion. So it should not be a surprise that the threat of AI and rise of fascism was on her mind. “Everyone wants designers to be revolutionary,” she added, with light despair. “But what is happening in the world? That is horrible.”</p>...\n",

       "{'body': '<p>TikTok <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-says-it-is-restoring-service-us-2025-01-19/\">said</a> on Sunday that it was restoring services in the US after Donald Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050\">pledged</a> earlier in the day to give the video app a reprieve on its US ban.</p> <p>Trump wrote on Truth Social that after taking office on Monday he would sign an executive order allowing the Chinese-owned video app additional time to find a buyer before facing a total shutdown, and proposing that the US or an American firm take a 50% ownership stake.</p> <p>“By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say (sic) up,” Trump said. “Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions.”</p> <p>TikTok stopped working in the US for 170 million users late on Saturday. Congress passed a law in April mandating its owner, ByteDance, either sell to a non-Chinese company or face a total shutdown. The app chose the shutdown after the US supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/17/politics-updates-supreme-court-tiktok?page=with:block-678a69dc8f08e357fb1e1097\">ruled </a>to uphold the ban on Friday.</p> <p>“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” stated a pop-up message to US users on TikTok on Saturday night, which came as something of a surprise, given that the law only required app stores to remove it. “Unfortunately that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”</p> <p>Trump attempted to intervene on TikTok’s behalf at the 11th hour, even though it was Trump who initially pushed for the ban. But he changed his tune after finding a large audience on the app during his 2024 presidential campaign.</p> <p>TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, released a video thanking Trump for his efforts to keep the app active in the US. He is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-trump-biden-china-bdc79b7ce741a81761f67ea56d410103\">expected </a>to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony in person.</p> <p>After Trump’s message on Sunday, TikTok’s website came back online for some US users, though the app itself initially remained dark.</p> <p>The incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-security-adviser-doesnt-rule-out-continued-chinese-ownership-tiktok-2025-01-19/\">told </a>CNN on Sunday that Trump hasn’t ruled out continued Chinese ownership, with “firewalls to make sure that the data is protected here on US soil”.</p> <p>He also said on CBS News on Sunday that Trump said he is working to “save” TikTok and needs time to sort out issues related to the firm and to evaluate potential buyers.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Trump could totally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/17/trump-stop-tiktok-ban\">circumvent the ban</a>, though he could order the justice department not to enforce the bill. He has also said the supreme court decision should be “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113844584193010573\">respected</a>”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, told <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5094094-mike-johnson-tiktok-ban-us-law/\">NBC’s Meet the Press </a>on Sunday that he intends to uphold the TikTok ban.</p> <p>“When President Trump issued the Truth post and said save TikTok, the way we read that is that he’s going to try to force along a true divestiture, changing of hands, the ownership,” Johnson said.</p> <p>He added members of Congress are not worried about the app itself but about the Chinese Communist Party, and said TikTok’s owners, ByteDance, had 270 days to sell the app in the US.</p> <p>Some Republicans have rejected the idea of extending the time before the ban goes into effect.</p> <p>“Now that the law has taken effect, there’s no legal basis for any kind of ‘extension’ of its effective date,” said the Senate intelligence committee chairman Tom Cotton (Republican of Arkansas) and Senator Pete Ricketts (Republican of Nebraska) in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1880965172040499650?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">joint statement</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>“For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law’s qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.”</p> <p>Several Democrats last week urged President Biden to issue a reprieve to give TikTok more time before shutting down.</p> <p>“It’s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer for TikTok,” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zlgotdjaxzuhw4nefvkxxvxa/post/3lfv3e6u7b22j?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.splinter.com%252Fidiot-democrats-hand-trump-a-gift-with-tiktok-flip-flop\">said</a> on 16 January. “We will continue working to keep TikTok alive, protect content creators’ livelihoods, protect against CCP surveillance, and protect national security. I will work with the Trump Admin to find a solution.”</p> <p>The Shark Tank celebrity investor Kevin O’Leary said on Friday he offered TikTok’s owners $20bn to buy it, while the company Perplexity AI has also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/perplexity-ai-bids-merge-with-tiktok-us-cnbc-reports-2025-01-18/\">reportedly </a>submitted a bid to merge with TikTok US, rather than purchase the app outright.</p>'}"
